TensorFlow is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:
-   Ubuntu 16.04 or later

GPU support is available for Ubuntu and Windows with CUDA®-enabled cards.

TensorFlow GPU support requires an assortment of drivers and libraries. To simplify installation and avoid library conflicts, we recommend using a [TensorFlow Docker image with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker) (Linux only). This setup only requires the [NVIDIA® GPU drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers).
